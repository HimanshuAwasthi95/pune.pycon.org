              He has been using Python day-to-day for DevOps, test automation and other stuff since 2009. About python, he says, "It's my favorite programming language: I love the terse expressiveness that I get with Python. Being able to try out quick experiments in REPLs like IPython and Jupyter is really handy. Due to the unparalleled gamut of modules (PyPi) and its great community, Python is still one of the hottest languages the world over." </div>
