                <h1>PyCon Pune 2018 - Sponsorship Prospectus</h1>

                <p>PyCon Pune is an annual gathering of the Pune Python community and its friends from across India and the world. During PyCon Pune, the community will meet for four days to exchange ideas via talks and contribute to mainstream Open Source projects including the Python interpreter.</p>

                <p>PyCon Pune met for the first time in February 2017 to a packed hall and active discussions among some of the leading professionals in the Python community worldwide and professionals and students all across the country.  550+ members from the community joined together for the first edition of PyCon Pune (2017). The event had 6 keynotes, which included a huge range of topics starting from Opportunities and Challenges in Open Collaboration, to hardware world, to Physics, to accessibility, to security, and tips on building career on upstream contribution. We also had another 9 regular talks in the main conference.</p>

                <p>The last two days of the conference was developer sprints. This was the first time in India we had this many upstream Python projects contributors sat down with new contributors, and helped them to submit patches to the projects. This list includes 11 patches that got merged into CPython (the Python programming language itself), Django, Web.py, ElasticSearch, FOSSASIA projects, and Fedora Infrastructure projects. PyCon Pune also had the 4 core Mailman team members participating in the sprints. The hardware hacking room at the developer sprints was full with various projects on MicroPython.</p>

                <p>We are now set to take that experience to the next level with PyCon Pune 2018 and we need you to be part of our story.</p>

The final two days are for developer sprints where select attendees get to work side by side with contributors to prominent Open Source projects and make some real contributions to the Python Open Source ecosystem.
