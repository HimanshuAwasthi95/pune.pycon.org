* Fix grammar in fixture that creates volunteers team (#522)
* CMS page fixes (#506, #519):

    Nav
    * [x] Just above 980px the logo is needs to be centered in between the edge of the screen and the navigation. It is currently to close to the nav.
    * [x] The “you are here” underline in the mockup nav bar (a) is tightly attached beneath its word, (b) does not stick out from under its word in either direction, and (c) is several pixels high to give it weight and to visually match the stroke width of the nice and weighty font. The line is too far beneath the word, and sticks out awkwardly to the right. It should be made to match the mockup if possible.

    Breadcrumbs
    * [x] The green breadcrumb container needs to be shorter and match the mockup i.e. less space above and below the breadcrumb text.
    * [x] Use Roboto Condensed Bold for the breadcrumb font.

* Nav and account bar fixes (#504, #507):

    * [x] Align the bottom of the main nav links with the bottom of the copy in the account buttons.
    * [x] Make account bar links Title case.
    * [x] Change main nav font family from Open Sans to Roboto Condensed.

* Home page design updates (#505, #514):

    Motto:
    * [x] The top and bottom rules should be 80% of the width of the text.
    * [x] Need more space between the top and bottom rules and the motto text.
    * [x] The font size should be larger, and the line height should be shorter.

    City Skyline:
    * [x] Double check that the color of the city image and the tan background of the main content section are exactly the same color they are currently slightly different and that must be corrected.

    TALKS/SESSION CHAIRS
    • Add the following fields to each talk slot:
    ⁃ Talk video URL
    ⁃ Talk slides URL
    ⁃ Talk assets URL
    ⁃ Those fields should exist in the /schedule/conference.json feed
    ⁃ There should be an API which I can use to update those URLs
    ⁃ it should be as simple as possible, since I'll call it from scripts
    ⁃ I don't care what it looks like, so long as I can call it with 3 lines
    of requests (ex, no oauth or anything complex)
    ⁃ Those fields should be editable from the django admin
    ⁃ If present and non-empty, they should be shown on the talk description page

    Set the video, slides, and assets URLs for a talk.

    Expects a POST, with an identifier for the talk as returned in
    the conf_key from the conference JSON API (/YYYY/schedule/conference.json)
    as part of the URL:

        http[s]://xxxxxxxxx/api/set_talk_urls/12345/

    and the request body a JSON-encoded dictionary with up to three keys:

      * video_url
      * slides_url
      * assets_url

    whose values are syntactically valid URLs.  The provided values will be
    set on the talk.

    Authentication is via an API key like other Pycon site APIs.

    :param conf_key: The 'conf_key' value returned for a slot by the conference
     JSON method.
    :returns: 202 status if successful
