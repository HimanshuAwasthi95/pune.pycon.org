        <h2>PAYMENT</h2>
        <div class="underline"></div>
        <p>
            We use Razorpay for processing payments. We/Razorpay do not store your

            complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your
            purchase transaction information is not saved.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our payment gateway adheres to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed
            by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands
            like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.
